Description: Goal of this package is to provide access to benchmark functions defined for
    the Special Session and Competition on Real-Parameter Single Objective Optimization in one place.
    The package contains functions from following years: 2013, 2014, 2015,
    2017, 2019, 2021, 2022 (<https://github.com/P-N-Suganthan>). 
    Implementations of CEC-2013 (Y. Gonzalez-Fernandez & M. Zambrano-Bigiarini) and CEC2017 (D. Jagodziński) are taken from existed R packages. Also, 
    the original C source code has been cleaned and reorganized for better readability.
